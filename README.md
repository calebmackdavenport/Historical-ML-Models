# Historical-ML-Models
Simple ML Algorithms based on Perceptrons

- A single python file containing the varying stages of utilizing and implementing the different types of basic artificial neurons. The perceptron file contains what can be utilized as a referencable API for leveraging the algorithms as needed.

- To leverage this as an API, code changes are required to reference a data file other than the sample set included, *iris.data*.

- Descriptions in the code explain each section and its underlying algorithm.
